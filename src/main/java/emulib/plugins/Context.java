/**
 * Context is a functional structure of a plugin that can be used by the other plugins.
 *
 * Plug-ins ask emuLib to get contexts of another plug-ins, by querying ContextController directly. If they are allowed
 * to get the context, emuLib returns the object (if it is found).
 *
 * Each plug-in can have none, one or more contexts, even implementing the same interface. Context interface can extend
 * standard context interfaces, provided by emuLib (such as CPUContext, MemoryContext, etc.). The last requirement is
 * to annotate context interfaces with @ContextType annotation.
